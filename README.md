# ChestSort
1.13 compatible Minecraft-/Spigot-Plugin to allow automatic chest sorting.

## About
Tired of sorting your chests? Let's spend less time on organizing, and more on playing!

ChestSort will automatically sort every chest after you have closed it. Every player can enable or disable this feature if desired with the simple command `/chestsort`. By default, sorting is disabled. If a player uses a chest for the first time after logging in, they will be shown a text on how to enable automatic chest sorting.
